Is the service RESTful? If not, why not? If so, what key features make it RESTful.

Yes, the service is RESTful. Key features of REST api: client-server (UI separate from server components), stateless, cacheable, uniform interface, and a layered system. The app does not rely on context (i.e., it is stateless).

What endpoints implement actions that are idempotent? nullipotent?

In homework 2, you are getting data. You never modify data, so maybe that's nullipotent since the data doesn't change, but maybe it's idempotent because you do get a result? In homework 3, adding a record (e.g., a player) is idempotent - adding the same record many times is equivalent to adding it many times. Maybe reading the player table is nullipotent? I'm not sure what reads count as.
